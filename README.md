# Card hover effects


Card hover effects are interactive design enhancements applied to card-based interfaces. Triggered by user hover, these effects often include animations or color changes, providing dynamic feedback and a visually engaging experience. Used in web development, they elevate user interfaces by adding a modern and responsive touch.
